// Package xamboo is a high quality framework for Web and Applications server, including a powerfull CMS
// with a metalnaguage built-in. It is made for GO 1.15 or higher, and is perfect for heavy load and REST APIs optimizations.
//
// Xamboo is the result of over 15 years of manufacturing engineering frameworks, originally written for PHP 7+ and now ported to GO 1.15+
//
// Xamboo is freeware, and uses several other freeware components (XConfig, XCore, XDominion, WAJAF)
//
// Xamboo is an engine to build applications that distribute any type of code to the client:
// It is completely independent of the generated code, i.e. you can send HTML, XHTML, XML, SGML, javascript, JSON, PDF, images, videos, etc.
//
// Xamboo works on sites currently distributing more than **90 millions web pages monthly**, (that's near 500 pages per second on peak hour) it serves regular sites, and GRAPH-APIs / REST APIs to APP-mobiles.
//
// The Xamboo server works only on Unix systems, since it makes a heavy use of plugins (.so librairies) that are not compatible with windows.
//
// # The full set of manuals for installation, configuration and programmation references is available on the github site
//
// https://www.github.com/webability-go/xamboo
//
// The runner:
//
// Will launch the system, load the configuration, start loggers, engines, components, listeners and link the handlers.
